Yasso is a brand of frozen Greek yogurt desserts that is available in all major grocery and club stores within the United States. Founded in 2009 by kindergarten best friends Amanda Klane and Drew Harrington, Yasso was the first to market frozen Greek yogurt, re-imagining dessert with indulgent flavors and quality ingredients that meet nutritional benchmarks. Yasso offers novelty stick bars, chocolate crunch bars, frozen Greek yogurt sandwiches, bite-size Yasso Poppables and Yasso Mochi, all of which can be found at grocery and club stores in the US.

Unilever has extended its portfolio of frozen desserts with the acquisition of US frozen Greek yogurt brand Yasso in Q3 2023.

In this project, we aim to dive into the world of YASSO by enabling them with the power of Rapid RROI to make strategic AI driven decisions.
